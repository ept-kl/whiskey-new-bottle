# Baileys bottle

## A little package fork from deadlinecode for storing all the data from baileys in whatever database you want to use by using typeorm

This package creates a store for a baileys bot instance. You can pass in a database connection to the functions and they will use that connection to create all the needed tables and save all the data to the database using typeorm, which supports all different kinds of databases.

TypeORM currently supports:

- MySQL
- MariaDB
- Postgres
- CockroachDB
- SQLite
- Microsoft¬†SQL¬†Server
- Oracle
- SAP¬†Hana
- sql.js

## Installation

```bash
npm install whiskey-new-bottle
```

## Usage

Take a look at the information in the [example folder](https://github.com/ept-kl/whiskey-new-bottle/blob/master/src/example/)

## I wanna tweak it for my own use case

Sure thing! You can tinker with the package like this:

1. Clone the repo

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ept-kl/whiskey-new-bottle .
   ```
2. Change stuff you wanna change
3. Build the package

   ```bash
   npm build
   ```
4. Install it in another nodejs project from wherever you saved it on your disk

   ```bash
   # inside your other project
   npm install /path/to/the/repo/named/whiskey-new-bottle
   ```

   or alternatively run the example
   ```bash
   # inside the package folder
   npm run example
   ```

## Found a bug or want to contribute because you're a cool person?

If you found an issue or would like to submit an improvement, please [open an issue here](https://github.com/ept-kl/whiskey-new-bottle/issues/new/choose).

If you actually have some spare time and want to contribute, feel free to open a PR and please don't forget to (create and) link the corresponding issue. `<br/>`
It's important so we can keep track of all the issues and feature requests that got resolved by PRs.

## Known issues/feature requests (WIP)

- [X] ~~Support multiple instance (currently only one instance is supported | mby by linking the corresponding stuff inside the auth table)~~
- [X] ~~Add the ability to change the behavior of data changes (e.g. if you want to keep deleted messages in the database)~~
- [ ] Improve the linking between tables (e.g. MessageDic.ts) by just linking to an account so resolving messages or other things to a single contact is easier

## You need help or want to exchange about things
